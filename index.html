<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>I chose to take this class not only because of real world applications, but also because of my personal interests. I have always been interested in art and design as well as science, so when we learned how to use google sites in school I wasn't satisfied with the amount of control I had over the website. I wanted to be able to build the website from the ground up and understand what went into it. I also think that with the use of technology in todays society it would be a very valuable skill to build a websites on your own and have a basic understanding of how coding works. I'm really excited to learn more about computer science and to practice applying my knowledge of design and art.</p1>
